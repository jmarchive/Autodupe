# Autodupe
Automatically dupe items via chunky donkeys on 2B2T-like servers.

### WARNING : It is still in development! DO NOT USE IT IN THE REAL SERVER!

## Installation

1. It's for Minecraft 1.12.2 and it's only tested in Forge version 14.23.5.2854.

2. It needs [Inertia Client](https://inertiaclient.com/download%20retriever/DownloadRetriever.php?MinecraftVersion=1.12.2%20forge) to work. Click the link to download it.(‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§ßÈôÜÁî®Êà∑Ê≥®ÊÑèÔºöÈúÄË¶ÅVPN)
3. It is a MOD. Simply paste the compiled `.jar` file into your `mods` folder, and enjoy!

## Usage

1. There must be donkeys and tunnels of 3 blocks high, 2 blocks wide and 120-150 blocks long.

   And you'll need items to dupeüòÇ.

   **IMPORTANT : Make sure there are not so many entities nearby, or you will follow them instead of following your donkey.**

2. Inventory of player who dupe items had better be EMPTY unless you want to make items which have not been picked up **disappear in five minutes** or throw items that should not be thrown into the hopper.

3. This program will automatically find the way to the **nearest hopper** and throw the duped items into it, which means it can be fully automatic. HOWEVER, the hopper should be **embedded** into the ground blocks instead of simply placing it on the ground or placing it into the sky. The best way is to dig a one-block-deep hole on the ground and place hopper into it.

4. START USING IT : Specific start command depends on the direction of your tunnel. Type in the chat box:

| Direction |  +X  |  -X  |  +Z  |  -Z  |
| :-------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  Command  | `!k` | `!l` | `!m` | `!n` |

5. STOP IT(**NOT DEVELOPED**) : Specific stop command depends on the direction of your tunnel. Type in the chat box:

| Direction |  +X  |  -X  |  +Z  |  -Z  |
| :-------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  Command  | `!t` | `!u` | `!v` | `!w` |

## Caution

### DO NOT REPEAT START COMMANDS EVEN YOU HAVE STOPPED!!!!!

**IF YOU TYPE IN ANY START COMMAND TWICE, YOUR GAME WILL CRASH AT ONCE!**

Because it's still in development, the ONLY WAY TO RESTART the dupe process is : **Exit the game and reenter the server, and then type in the start command.**
